Simple boilerplate using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com).

Designed to accelerate very small personal projects. If you are building a larger/professional product, this is likely not for you.
